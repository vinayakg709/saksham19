                            Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College has always aimed for holistic and all-round development of its students.
                             Apart from academics, the college also pays equal concern over the physical development of the students,
                              and in the spirit of the game the college organized INTER DEPARTMENTAL SPORTS EVENTS that spanned over two months.
                              The events witnessed a massive participation of more than 1500 students in about 24 different sporting events.
                             A total of  256 matches were played during the course of the sports meet.
